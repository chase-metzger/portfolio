I’m a 22 year old computer software and hardware enthusiast with 6 years of experience in solving simple to complex problems in logical and elegant ways. I have spent my time the last 6 years learning (“self”-taught) about both software and hardware from the standpoint of low level physics to high level programming API’s in multiple programming languages. I come well equipped with an high level of eagerness to learn, solve people’s problems in a simple way and gain work experience.
